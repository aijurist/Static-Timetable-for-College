# Timetable Solver Configuration
# All values can be overridden via system properties or environment variables

# Solver runtime settings
solver.minutes=30
solver.threads=auto

# Construction heuristic phase settings
solver.construction.seconds=300

# Local search settings
solver.late.acceptance.size=400
solver.entity.tabu.size=7
solver.accepted.count.limit=4

# Progress monitoring
solver.progress.logging=true
solver.progress.interval.seconds=30

# Performance tuning notes:
# - Increase solver.minutes for better solutions (but longer runtime)
# - Increase solver.threads for faster solving on multi-core systems
# - Increase solver.construction.seconds if initial solution is poor
# - Adjust solver.late.acceptance.size and solver.entity.tabu.size for different search behaviors
